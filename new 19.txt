After six months of endless research I am pleased to share a very difficult project I started this year.
Abyss Engine(just a simulation of Unity Engine)

I began this project this year(2024) and first started with a game engine I learnt from youtube,
I went a step further into making an editor for the engine after completing my 3d Graphics Microcredential class at University of Victoria.

Features:
Entity Component System(ECS)
Scene Management and Serialization
Runtime Scripting and Dynamic Compilation
Simple Collision Detection(AABB)
Import System for Assets
User Interface - scene hierarchy, component inspector, file viewer and debug console

Languages:
C++, Lua for scripting

Third party libraries:
SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
IMGUI: Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface
SOL: Simple Object Layer
NFD: Native File Dialog
